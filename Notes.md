## Tailwind CSS

- if we need a custom/arbitary style, which is not defined in pre-defined utilities in tailwind, we can use Just in Time(JIT) Compiler AND SPECIAL SYNTAX to create new css class.

for example
 font size 13px

 text-[13px] // special syntax []

 - Tailwind is lean
 - contains only styles that are necessary

 - with JIT compiler
 - speeds up the build process
 - supports custom styles
 - keeps the css consistent in both development and production
 - improves how websites perform in browsers
